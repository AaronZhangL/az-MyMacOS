Q1.
“Application windows are expected to have a root view controller at the end of application launch” error when running a project with Xcode 7, iOS 9

A1.
From your error message:

Application windows are expected to have a root view controller at the end of application launch
How old is this "old" project? If it's more than a few years, do you still have:

[window addSubview:viewController.view];
You should instead replace it with:

[window setRootViewController:viewController];
